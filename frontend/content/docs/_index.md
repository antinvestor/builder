## Getting Started

Welcome to ant.build documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to start building with AI-powered code generation.

### Quick Start

1. **Create your first project** - Describe what you want to build using natural language
2. **Review the generated code** - Our AI generates production-ready code with tests
3. **Iterate and refine** - Give feedback to improve the output
4. **Deploy when ready** - Choose your hosting and go live

### Core Concepts

- **Specifications**: How to describe your project effectively
- **Code Generation Pipeline**: Understanding how our AI works
- **Testing**: Automatic testing for every feature
- **Security**: How we keep your code safe
