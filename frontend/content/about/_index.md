## Our Mission

We believe every developer should have access to the best AI tools for building software. That's why code generation is free—we want to democratize access to AI-powered development.

## The Problem We're Solving

Building software is still too slow. Developers spend countless hours on:

- **Boilerplate code** that could be generated automatically
- **Repetitive patterns** that follow well-known conventions
- **Writing tests** for code that follows predictable patterns
- **Documentation** that describes what the code already says

Our AI handles these tasks, freeing developers to focus on what matters: solving unique problems and building great products.

## Our Approach

### Multi-LLM Intelligence

We don't rely on a single AI model. Our platform uses Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini together, routing each task to the model that handles it best.

### Production-Ready Output

We don't just generate code—we generate complete, tested, documented features that are ready for production.

### Security First

Every feature goes through security scanning. Your code is generated and tested in isolated sandboxes with enterprise-grade protection.

### Developer Experience

We built ant.build for developers. That means:
- Clean, readable code that follows your project's conventions
- Comprehensive tests that actually test the right things
- Documentation that's actually useful
- Git integration that just works

## Our Team

We're a remote-first team of engineers who've built developer tools at companies like Google, Stripe, and GitHub. We're backed by leading investors who believe in our vision.

## Our Values

**Transparency**: We're open about how our platform works, what it costs, and where it falls short.

**Quality**: We'd rather generate less code that works perfectly than more code that needs fixing.

**Accessibility**: AI-powered development should be available to everyone, not just well-funded companies.

**Privacy**: Your code is yours. We don't use your code to train models or share it with anyone.
